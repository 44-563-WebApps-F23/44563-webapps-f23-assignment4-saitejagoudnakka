        Have you just come to town? Eh?
        
        </p>
        <p>
        MRS. ELVSTED.
        
        I arrived yesterday, about midday. Oh, I was quite in despair when I
        heard that you were not at home.
        </p>
        <p>
        HEDDA.
        
        In despair! How so?
    </p>
    <p>
        TESMAN.
        
        Why, my dear Mrs. Rysing--I mean Mrs. Elvsted--
    </p>
    <p>
        
        HEDDA.
        
        I hope that you are not in any trouble?
        
    </p>
    <p> 
        MRS. ELVSTED.
        
        Yes, I am. And I don't know another living creature here that I can turn
        to.
    </p>
    <p>
        HEDDA.
        
        [Laying the bouquet on the table.] Come--let us sit here on the sofa--
